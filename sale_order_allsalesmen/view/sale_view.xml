				from your customers. OpenERP suggests that you start by creating a
				quotation. Once it is confirmed, the quotation will be converted
				into a Sales Order. OpenERP can handle several types of products so
				that a sales order may trigger tasks, delivery orders, manufacturing
				orders, purchases and so on. Based on the configuration of the sales
				order, a draft invoice will be generated so that you just have to
				confirm it when you want to bill your customer.</field>
